    <h1>About CSS</h1>
    <p>
        CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is a stylesheet language used for describing the presentation and formatting of a document written in HTML or XML. CSS provides a way to separate the content of a web page from its presentation, allowing for greater flexibility and control over the visual appearance of web pages.

With CSS, you can define styles that affect various elements on a web page, including text, colors, layouts, spacing, borders, backgrounds, and more. By applying CSS rules to HTML elements, you can control how they are displayed and how they interact with other elements on the page.

CSS operates on a cascading principle, which means that multiple CSS rules can be applied to the same element, and they will be applied in a specific order based on their specificity and the cascade rules. This allows for a high level of control over the styling and allows you to create consistent and visually appealing designs.

CSS can be written inline within HTML elements, embedded in the &lt;style&gt; tags in the &lt;head&gt;section of an HTML document, or placed in an external CSS file and linked to the HTML document using the &lt;link&gt; tag.

Overall, CSS is a powerful tool for web design and development, enabling you to create visually appealing and responsive web pages by controlling the layout, styling, and presentation of your content.
